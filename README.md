# Thoughs about hardware design

This project is part of the "Kanbaiyi" project to introduce and list all aspects that need to be considered in hardware design. It is purely a summary of personal experience, not a professional recitation.

There are still many obstacles ahead. This is part of Kan Baiyi’s plan. I hope these tasks will live up to expectations.

In addition to the main text, this warehouse also adds many PCB design examples and gadgets related to hardware design and other rich connotations. The warehouse capacity is large (about 400MB), and you can download the ZIP directly without cloning.
